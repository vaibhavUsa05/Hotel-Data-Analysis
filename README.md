Title: Hotel Data Analysis: Uncovering Valuable Insights for Business Growth

Abstract: This data analysis project focuses on exploring the dataset of the popular City and Resort hotels, to gain valuable insights into customer behavior and 
identify general trends. Leveraging Python and libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we undertake various stages of the data analysis pipeline, including data cleaning, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization. By extracting meaningful information from the dataset, 
we aim to provide actionable recommendations for enhancing the Hotel's performance and fostering business growth.
